My way for fixing bug with Bootstrap Modals and fullwidth fixed elements
========================================================================

There is a bug with Bootstrap Modals and fullwidth fixed elements

Structure
=============
`/src/` - thats where you write code.

`/build/` - compiled code. Do not ever edit this folder.


How to use
=============

1) `$ gulp` - it will build your site and start local server at <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>
2) `$ npm run build` - it will delete your build folder first and then compile project in production mode(using code minifying etc.)
